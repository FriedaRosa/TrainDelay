# TrainDelay
> There is a suspicious number of daily train delays between KÃ¶ln Hbf and Spich.

This repo is for a shiny app to retrieve Deutsche Bahn delays for any station in Germany, filter by line, or just visualise the delays over time. 
The app creates visualisations about which trains win the prize of the most delayed train at a certain station, visualises how overall delayed trains are at a specific station and enables downloading of the data to create an archive.
